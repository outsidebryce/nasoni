## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application screens and layouts
- `components/`: Reusable React components
- `assets/`: Images, icons, and fonts
- `styles/`: Global styles and themes
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for project management

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready to start from scratch, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Customization

The app supports theme customization. You can modify the themes in the `styles/themes.ts` file.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with smart home ecosystems
- Water usage analytics and reports
- Multi-language support
- Push notifications for maintenance and alerts
